This is a test project in order to learn Claude and learn about agentic workflow.

The objective is to create a new application from scratch that adheres to modern software development
standards and includes multiple agents, each with a specific role and domain knowledge.

We are using test driven development.

## Agentic Workflow Rules

1. **Delegate code writing to subagents** - The main agent should not write code directly. Instead, use the Task tool to spawn subagents for all code writing tasks.
